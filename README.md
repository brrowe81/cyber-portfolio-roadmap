# Cyber Portfolio Roadmap

> Hello, friend. This repo tracks my hands-on cybersecurity portfolio and serves as a public plan of record for labs, artifacts, and milestones.

---

## 📌 Scope & Goals
**Primary goal:** demonstrate practical capability across blue-team, offensive security (ethical), forensics, scripting/automation, and cloud security.

**Outcomes I’ll show:**
- End-to-end investigations (data → analysis → detection/remediation)
- Reproducible lab write-ups with screenshots, queries, and scripts
- Clear documentation & version control discipline

---

## 🧭 Labs (Workstream Tracker)
- [ ] **Network Analysis — Wireshark PCAPs**  
  *Artifacts:* sanitized PCAPs, filters/notes, screenshots, write-ups  
  *Repo:* `network-analysis-wireshark` (link when created)

- [ ] **SIEM Detection Lab — ELK/Splunk**  
  *Artifacts:* ingest config, saved searches/dashboards, Sigma/KQL rules, detections  
  *Repo:* `siem-detection-lab`

- [ ] **Digital Forensics — Autopsy/Volatility**  
  *Artifacts:* case notes, timelines, IOCs, screenshots, report  
  *Repo:* `digital-forensics-lab`

- [ ] **Pentest Lab — DVWA / Metasploitable (Ethical/Isolated)**  
  *Artifacts:* recon results, exploit chain, privesc notes, remediation guidance  
  *Repo:* `pentest-lab`

- [ ] **Cyber Automation Scripts — Python/Bash**  
  *Artifacts:* log parser, hash checker, mini port scanner, CLI docs & tests  
  *Repo:* `cyber-scripts`

- [ ] **Cloud Security Demos — AWS/GCP/Azure**  
  *Artifacts:* IAM/S3 hardening demos, misconfig reproduction, detections/alerts  
  *Repo:* `cloud-security-lab`

## ✅ Definition of Done (per lab)
- [ ] Repo created with `README.md` (Scenario → Method → Findings → Mitigations)  
- [ ] Repro steps are **clear and tested**  
- [ ] Screenshots & queries/scripts included  
- [ ] Risks & **defenses** documented  
- [ ] Final summary + “What I’d improve next”  
- [ ] Linked back here under **Labs** (above)

## 🧩 Project Board / Roadmap
- Track with **Issues** + **Project** (Kanban or Roadmap)
- Labels: `lab`, `investigation`, `docs`
